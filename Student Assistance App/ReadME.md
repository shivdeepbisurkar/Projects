## My Contribution and Role in the Project

Throughout the project, I played a pivotal role in various phases, contributing to the successful development of the **Student Assist App**. Here's a breakdown of my contributions and responsibilities:

#### Analysis Report
In the initial stages, I took charge of identifying and analyzing critical system requirements, particularly focusing on the collaboration tool, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements. This experience provided me with valuable insights into effective requirement analysis and its impact on the design process.

#### Test Plan
During the test planning phase, I collaborated closely with my team to formulate comprehensive testing strategies, select appropriate testing tools, and create well-structured test data based on the analysis report. My primary focus was on developing detailed test cases, test data, and test strategies. I gained a deep understanding of different testing methodologies, cross-functional collaboration, and the iterative nature of test planning.

#### Design Report
I actively participated in exploring multiple design strategies and contributed significantly to the context model and design approach sections of the design report. Leading the design approach, I provided recommendations for enhancing the user experience. This task deepened my understanding of design considerations, functional and non-functional requirements, and the intricacies of evaluating design choices.

#### Design Review
During the design review process, I played a critical role in evaluating our partner team's design report. Summarizing the report and offering recommendations for improvement, including sections related to the Job search algorithm, Collaboration tool, and non-functional requirements. This experience emphasized the importance of collaborative feedback, alignment with requirements, and documentation of design decisions.

#### Finishing Touches
Collaborating closely with my teammate, we undertook the development of a working prototype using 'ProtoPie.' Our goal was to craft a user-friendly interface that aligned with user needs. We meticulously designed application pages, considered usability factors such as font size, color schemes, and placement of buttons, and integrated essential features like notifications and messaging. This hands-on experience taught us the significance of user-centered design, attention to detail, and efficient iteration.

In conclusion, my journey through the project allowed me to contribute significantly to requirement analysis, test planning, design evaluation, and the development of a functional prototype. This experience reinforced the importance of teamwork, adherence to requirements, and iterative design practices in creating an impactful app. I'm excited to continue refining the app and enhancing the user experience.
